# Frontend (Next.js) â€” EV Dashboard

This folder contains a minimal Next.js app that renders charts from a JSON snapshot of the dataset placed in `frontend/public/ev_data.json`.

Install and run locally (Windows/cmd.exe):

1. From repository root, change to frontend:

```cmd
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies (npm):

```cmd
npm install
```

Or with bun (if installed):

```cmd
bun install
```

3. Run dev server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000

Generating `ev_data.json`:

From the repository root you can generate a JSON snapshot of the whole CSV dataset that the frontend will read:

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\csv_to_frontend_json.py
```

This writes `frontend/public/ev_data.json` (already done in your session).

If instead you prefer to use the CSV summaries generated by the insights script, copy CSVs from `outputs/` into `frontend/public/data/` and update the client fetch paths accordingly.

Cleanup: accidentally committed `node_modules` or other large files

If you see 10k+ changed files in your source control because `node_modules/` was committed, here's how to clean that up (run from repo root):

```cmd
# 1. Ensure `.gitignore` includes `node_modules/` and `frontend/node_modules/` (it does)
# 2. Remove node_modules from the index without deleting files locally
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git rm -r --cached frontend/node_modules
# 3. Commit the removal
git commit -m "chore: remove node_modules from source control"
# 4. Push
git push
```

After that, future `node_modules/` will be ignored.

Notes on bundlers

- Use `npm` if you prefer the Node.js ecosystem. `bun` is an alternative runtime that can be faster; `bun install` can be used in place of `npm install`.
- The repo is scaffolded for Next.js; building with `npm run build` is the standard flow.
